### Abstract
What a Mesh! is a Unity plugin that provides unique tools to easily deform and manipulate meshes in editor and during runtime.

The *smudge tool* can be compared to working with modeling clay; you can deform an object by dragging a part of it in your desired direction. By choosing a radius beforehand, the affected area can be modified to be as big as one wishes. To avoid stretched-out vertices and fractals, automatic and scalable polygon generation algorithms were implemented. 

The *slice tool* is dividing one object - and its mesh - into two individual objects. There will be a straight cut that you execute with two clicks. 

### Plugin Usage
In a Unity project, go to `Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package` and select the downloaded .unitypackage from the repository's `/binaries` folder. 
Please consult the doxygen documentation in `/documentation` for further information. 

### Process
During development, the progress and tasks were tracked using [Notion](https://slender-frill-8ba.notion.site/What-a-Mesh-b4c90bf3ae82463baffd4a65692dce18) in a semi-organised structure.
